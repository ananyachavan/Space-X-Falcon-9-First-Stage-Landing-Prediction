# Space-X-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction
ML pipeline predicting Falcon 9 first stage landings. Explore data, train models, find best method. For rocket launch cost estimation.
This repository contains a machine learning pipeline designed to predict whether the first stage of a Space X Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. Leveraging data from preceding labs and exploratory data analysis, this project aims to provide insights into the likelihood of first stage recovery, a crucial factor in determining the cost-effectiveness of rocket launches.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and determine training labels.
- Create a classification column for the first stage landing outcome.
- Standardize the data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
- Split the dataset into training and test data for model evaluation.
- Identify the best hyperparameters for Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression models.
- Evaluate the performance of each method using test data and determine the most effective approach for first stage landing prediction.

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Contains code for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
